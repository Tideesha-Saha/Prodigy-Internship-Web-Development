        <h2>About This Task</h2>
        <!-- <p>This is part of the Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech.</p> -->

        <p>
          This project was developed as part of the Web Development Internship
          at
          <strong>Prodigy Infotech</strong>. The primary goal was to design and
          build a responsive landing page that demonstrates key frontend
          development skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this task, I gained hands-on experience in structuring web
          pages using HTML, styling them with modern CSS techniques such as
          Flexbox and gradients, and adding interactivity with JavaScript. The
          fixed navigation bar with scroll-based styling, hover animations, and
          fully responsive layout are highlights of this task.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project reflects the foundational skills essential for building
          engaging and user-friendly web interfaces, and sets the stage for more
          advanced frontend projects.
